## Description of My Work
This project involves creating a personal website using HTML and CSS. The website aims to showcase my academic achievements, progress in my degree program, and provide information about myself. The website includes sections like "About Me," "My Degree," "My Projects," and "Contact."

## Problems During the Development
During the development of the website, I faced some challenges, including:
- **Responsive design issues**: At first, I had difficulty making the site adjust properly to different screen sizes.
- **GitHub Pages connection**: I took some time to correctly set up the deployment of the site on GitHub Pages.
- **File organization**: Initially, I struggled with deciding how to organize the folders to keep the project clean and easy to maintain.

## Conclusions
In this project, I learned a lot about website structure, using Git and GitHub for version control, and deploying websites. Although I faced some challenges, I am satisfied with the final result. If I could improve something, I would work more on accessibility and image optimization.
