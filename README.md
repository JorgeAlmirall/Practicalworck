Reflection on the Development of the Web Project
This project has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. As a first-year Computer Engineering student, I had the opportunity to apply the concepts I learned in the "Web Development" subject, but I also encountered many obstacles along the way. The task required creating a website using HTML and CSS, organizing files properly, and publishing the project on GitHub. Although the process was demanding, it taught me valuable lessons and enhanced my problem-solving abilities.

Challenges Faced
One of the primary difficulties I encountered during the project was the organization of the project files. Initially, I struggled with the duplication of folders, which led to confusion regarding where each file should be placed. At one point, I had to delete everything and start from scratch because I had lost track of the file structure. This experience taught me the importance of maintaining a clear and organized file system from the very beginning.

Additionally, managing the CSS styling for multiple pages proved to be another challenge. I found myself frequently making adjustments and refinements to achieve a consistent design across all pages, especially with layout issues and responsiveness. Sometimes, small changes in one file would affect the layout of other pages, causing additional adjustments. Debugging CSS can be tricky due to its cascading nature, where styles can be overridden unintentionally. To handle this, I spent time studying the intricacies of the box model and layout techniques, like flexbox and grid, to ensure all elements were aligned correctly.

Solutions Implemented
To address the issue of folder duplication and disorganization, I carefully restructured the project directory, making sure to have separate folders for images, CSS files, and HTML files. This was key to making the development process smoother and more manageable. Additionally, I created a README.md file to document the project, explaining its purpose, structure, and technologies used. This documentation also helped clarify the project’s structure and serve as a reference for future updates.

For the CSS styling challenges, I focused on learning and practicing best practices for responsive design. I used CSS Flexbox and Grid layout systems to create flexible, adaptable layouts that work well on different screen sizes. I also took extra care to test the website in different browsers to ensure compatibility. Whenever I encountered a problem, I referred to online resources, such as MDN Web Docs and CSS-Tricks, which provided comprehensive guides and examples. These resources helped me understand how to use CSS more effectively and resolve issues with layout and styling.

Another challenge was the Git and GitHub workflow. I had to learn how to manage my commits properly and ensure that each HTML file was pushed separately, as required by the project guidelines. Initially, I encountered issues with committing and pushing my changes to GitHub. However, I gradually became more comfortable using Git commands, and I was able to set up my repository correctly after some trial and error. I also made sure to add my collaborator, momartinufv, and followed the instructions to push my changes incrementally.

Resources Used
Several resources were essential in helping me complete this project. Among the most useful were:

MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): This site is an invaluable resource for learning both HTML and CSS. The comprehensive documentation, examples, and tutorials provided detailed explanations of HTML tags, CSS properties, and design techniques.

CSS-Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/): A highly regarded website for learning CSS. It offers tutorials, guides, and tips for solving common CSS problems. The articles on Flexbox and CSS Grid were particularly useful for creating flexible layouts.

W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/): This website is a great starting point for beginners, offering simple and clear tutorials on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies.

Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/): Whenever I faced a coding issue that I couldn’t solve, Stack Overflow was a lifesaver. It’s a community-driven platform where developers ask questions and share solutions. I often found answers to the problems I encountered while debugging my code.

GitHub Docs (https://docs.github.com/en/github): This was essential for learning how to manage my GitHub repository. It provided clear instructions on committing changes, managing branches, and collaborating with others.
Conclusion
This project has been a valuable learning experience that tested my skills in web development, problem-solving, and collaboration. While I faced challenges such as file organization, CSS styling, and using Git, I was able to overcome them with persistence and by seeking help from various online resources. Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of web technologies and learned the importance of planning, testing, and organizing my work. I look forward to continuing to develop my skills in web development and learning more about the ever-evolving field of computer engineering.
